# TEST INFRA

Test Infra provides you with the capacity to 
perform tests on FlexTyper.
The reason why TestInfra was created was to 
be able to generate several results in a very 
simple way. Indeed, TestInfra takes a json file as
input and will generate results according to the 
input configuration file.
